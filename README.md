airinstruments
==============

In late 2012 I created a motion-controlled harp demo using prototype hardware from [LEAP Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/). The demo was a big hit and LEAP embraced the project into their developer outreach program. This led to me quitting my engineering job at Universal Audio in 2013 and starting [Handwavy](http://handwavy.com). We launched two apps on day one in LEAP Motion's Airspace app store: [AirHarp](https://gallery.leapmotion.com/airharp/) and [AirBeats](https://gallery.leapmotion.com/airbeats/)
.

LEAP Motion has recently moved to a new model in which these apps can be downloaded free of charge, so I am open-sourcing these projects in case they are useful to anyone exploring the realms of interactive musical app development. The interesting subfolder are:

[`common`](https://github.com/AdamSomers/airinstruments/tree/master/common)
[`airdrums`](https://github.com/AdamSomers/airinstruments/tree/master/airdrums)
[`airharp-draft3`](https://github.com/AdamSomers/airinstruments/tree/master/airharp-draft3)

Credits are due to the following people:
- Bob Nagy, Software Engineering
- Ryan Dunn & Wyeth Hansen of [Labour NY](http://labour-ny.com/), UI Design
- Reavis Mitchell, Sound Design
- David Cohen, Sound Design
- Sean Price, Sound Design
- Jake Baruch, Product ideation & brainstorming
- Michael Sutherland, Primary LEAP Motion liason
- [Jennah Delp](http://isingsv.com/), My amazing and supportive wife

This project relies heavily on the amazing C++ framework [`JUCE`](https://juce.com/).
