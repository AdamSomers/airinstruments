AirBeats - Release Notes

Note that all kits have the same placeholder sounds, except HipHop which has different placeholder sounds, and Analog Dub which is has a rough draft of the final soundset for that kit.  Also note most of the buttons have temporary graphics.

Please send all comments to adam@handwavy.co.  Thanks!

Usage:

- "Air drum" in left or right half of the Leap's field of view to play the L or R sound.

- The application detectects rapid downward movement of your hands.  You can play in a variety of ways: open hands, finger extended, closed fist (imaginary drumstick), or using tools.

- When not drumming, a cursor tacks where you are pointing to on the screen (use one finger or tool to move the cursor).

- All buttons are activated by hovering the cursor over the button.

- Select kits and patterns by bringing the wheels into view with the arrow buttons, and use the up/down buttons that appear to make your selection.

- Change the tempo using the left/right buttons on either side of the tempo display.

- Control the transport (play/record/metronome) using the transport buttons in the upper-right.

- An audio settings dialog is available in the Options menu, in case you need to use a different audio device.

- Patterns can be saved from the file menu.
