AirBeats - Release Notes

General note: This is a preview build distributed for the sole purpose of showing progress and soliciting early feedback.  Many features remain in an un-implemented or half-implemented state.  The most useful feedback for us is:

- Does the app run at all?
- Do the implemented features work as expected?
- How can we better make use of motion control and gestures?

Note also that all the graphics are temporary.  They exist only to define the general layout and functionality.

Please send all comments to adsomers@gmail.com.  Thanks!

Usage:

- Tap on the left or right half of the Leap's field of view to play the L or R sound.
- Sideways-tap over the drum selectors to change the L or R sound
- One clockwise circle gesture starts the transport
- Two clockwise circles toggles record mode
- Three clockwise circles toggles the metronome
- One counter-clockwise circle stops the transport
- Two counter-clockwise circles resets the transport to start of pattern
- Three counter-clockwise circles clears the pattern

An audio settings dialog is available in the Options menu, in case you need to use a different audio device.

Patterns can be saved and loaded from the File menu.  These dialogs will be incorporated into the main application UI as side-bars and will be fully motion controlled.
