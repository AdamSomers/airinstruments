					<h1>Using the Leap Motion Application  </h1>

<p>This article describes the Leap application that acts as an intermediary<br/>
between the Leap Motion Controller and your Leap-enabled application.</p>

<h2>Overview  </h2>

<p>The Leap application communicates with the Leap Motion Controller hardware and <br/>
transmits hand tracking data to Leap-enabled applications. Thus, the Leap<br/>
application must be running when you access Leap data in your<br/>
application.</p>

<p>When the Leap application is running, it displays an icon in the<br/>
notification area of the Windows Taskbar or Mac Finder bar. When the<br/>
Leap device is plugged in and working properly, the icon turns green.<br/>
The icon will flash yellow while the software is initializing and turn<br/>
red if an error has occurred.</p>

<ul>
<li><img src="../../docs/images/Leap_App_Icon_Unplugged.png" alt="Unplugged-Icon" /> — the Leap<br/>
device is unplugged (or the Leap application hasn&rsquo;t detected it<br/>
yet).</li>
<li><img src="../../docs/images/Leap_App_Icon_Normal.png" alt="Normal-Icon" /> — the Leap device<br/>
and application are operating normally.</li>
<li><img src="../../docs/images/Leap_App_Icon_Robust.png" alt="Robust-Icon" /> — the Leap is<br/>
operating in robust mode. See Operating Modes_ for more<br/>
information.</li>
<li><img src="../../docs/images/Leap_App_Icon_Error.png" alt="Error-Icon" /> — an error has occured<br/>
from which the Leap application is unable to recover. Open the<br/>
application log using the <code>Show Log</code> menu command for more<br/>
information about the error.</li>
</ul>


<p>When you first run the Leap software, it checks to see if you have<br/>
logged in with your Leap developer credentials and whether you have the<br/>
calibration file for your Leap device, which is necessary to run the<br/>
Leap. The Leap software automatically downloads the calibration file for<br/>
your device after you log in.</p>

<h2>Menu commands  </h2>

<p>The Leap application has a number of commands that modify how tracking<br/>
data is produced and which give you information about the state of the<br/>
device. Access these commands through the menu attached to the<br/>
application icon.</p>

<p>The Leap application provides the following menu commands:</p>

<ul>
<li>Settings&hellip; — Opens the Leap Software Settings dialog.</li>
<li>Check for Updates — checks to see if an update for the Leap software<br/>
and SDK is available</li>
<li>Open Log — displays a log of events generated by the Leap<br/>
application; see Application log_</li>
<li>Recalibrate Device&hellip; — launches the device calibration utility; see<br/>
Device recalibration_</li>
<li>Visualizer&hellip; — launches the Visualizer application; see <a href="Leap_Visualizer.html">Leap<br/>
Visualizer</a></li>
<li>Report a Bug&hellip; — opens the bug report dialog; see Reporting bugs_</li>
<li>About — provides the Leap application version number as well as<br/>
links to our website and support email address</li>
</ul>


<p>Note that some of these commands are targeted toward developers. The<br/>
consumer version of the Leap application will have a different set of<br/>
user commands and options.</p>

<h2>Leap Software Settings  </h2>

<p>You can adjust the behavior of the Leap application using the Leap<br/>
Software Settings dialog.</p>

<p>On the <em>Tracking</em> page, you can set the operating mode (see<br/>
Operating modes_) and reverse the horizontal orientation with the <em>Flip<br/>
Tracking</em> button.</p>

<p>On the <em>Logging</em> page, you can set log file options, save the current<br/>
log to a file, and set automatic bug reporting options.</p>

<p>On the <em>Screen</em> page you can register the relationship between the Leap<br/>
device and a selected monitor so that the Leap can accurately calculate<br/>
the intersection of the screen with rays projected from fingers and<br/>
tools. See Screen location_.</p>

<h2>Operating modes  </h2>

<p>The Leap has several operating modes which determine how the application<br/>
analyzes data. The following modes are user-selectable from the Software<br/>
Settings dialog of the Leap Application:</p>

<ul>
<li>Precision — prioritizes precision over speed</li>
<li>Balanced — balances precision with speed</li>
<li>High Speed — prioritizes speed over precision</li>
<li>Robust Mode — prioritizes tracking robustness over speed</li>
<li>Low Resource — reduces the USB bandwidth used by the Leap</li>
</ul>


<p>The Leap <em>Robust Mode</em> improves the reliability of the tracking data in<br/>
bright lighting conditions. Robust mode allows the Leap to operate in a<br/>
wider range of environmental conditions; however, other performance<br/>
characteristics may be reduced. The main effects on performance are that<br/>
there will be increased processing latency and very fast motions by the<br/>
user will cause a loss of tracking data.</p>

<p>The Leap automatically drops into robust mode when lighting conditions<br/>
become poor. The Leap switches back into the last user-selected<br/>
operating mode when lighting conditions improve, but will remain in<br/>
robust mode for at least 30 seconds. The Leap application icon changes<br/>
from green to yellow when in this mode.</p>

<p>When the Leap enters robust mode because it detects bad lighting<br/>
conditions, it saves a diagnostic file. If the cause of the lighting<br/>
problem is not obvious, you can send this diagnostic file to Leap<br/>
Motion. This may help us improve the lighting analysis algorithms. See<br/>
Reporting bugs_ for information about diagnostic files.</p>

<h2>Device recalibration  </h2>

<p>If the sensors on the Leap device are knocked out of their initial<br/>
alignment, the device must be recalibrated. Symptoms that may indicate<br/>
the need to recalibrate include:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Persistent jumpiness</li>
<li>Frequent discontinuities in the tracking data</li>
<li>Aberrations in tracking data that occur only in certain areas of<br/>
the field of view</li>
<li>Poor tracking range</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>You can look for these symptoms using the the <a href="Leap_Visualizer.html">Leap<br/>
Visualizer</a>.</p>

<p>To recalibrate your Leap device:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Leap Application menu using the icon on the Windows Taskbar<br/>
or Mac Finder bar.</li>
<li>Select the <em>Recalibrate Device</em> command.</li>
<li><p>Follow the on-screen instructions to perform the calibration<br/>
procedure.</p>

<p><img src="../../docs/images/Leap_Recalibrate.png" alt="Calibration" /></p></li>
</ol>


<p>You will need a flat, reflective surface. A mirror is ideal, but many<br/>
other reflective surfaces like a flat screen monitor will work accetably<br/>
as well. During the procedure, hold the Leap so that the LEDs shine on<br/>
the reflective surface and are reflected back into the top of the<br/>
device. The calibration window displays a disk that moves as you change<br/>
the angle between the surface and the device. Rotate the Leap to move<br/>
this disc so that it &ldquo;paints&rdquo; the window. Moving the Leap up and down or<br/>
side to side does not adversely affect the calibration, but calibration<br/>
requires rotation.</p>

<h2>Reporting bugs  </h2>

<p>If you are having problems with the Leap software, please contact us so<br/>
we can help you resolve the issue. You can submit reports on the ~!@<a href="https://developer.leapmotion.com">Leap<br/>
Motion</a>@!~ Developer Portal or by using<br/>
the Bug Report form of the Leap Application.</p>

<p>We may ask you to reproduce the issue on your device and record some<br/>
diagnostic information which you can send to ~!@<a href="https://developer.leapmotion.com">Leap<br/>
Motion</a>@!~ to help us assess the problem.<br/>
You can start and stop the recording of diagnostic information from the<br/>
Leap Bug Report form. The data is compressed and encrypted and is not<br/>
useful for your local application debugging. The data recorded can grow<br/>
large over time, so we do not recommend recording diagnostics for an<br/>
extended period.</p>

<p>To report a bug,</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Leap Application menu using the icon on the Windows Taskbar<br/>
or Mac Finder bar.</li>
<li>Select the Report Bug command.</li>
<li>On the Bug Report form, select the reason that best fits your bug<br/>
from the Reason drop-down list.</li>
<li>Add any important details, such as how to reproduce your bug in the<br/>
Details section.</li>
<li>For some types of bugs, you will be asked to record diagnostic<br/>
information.</li>
<li>When finished, click the Send button. Your bug information and<br/>
recorded diagnostics will be sent to Leap Motion.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you are asked to record diagnostic information,</p>

<ol>
<li>Press the <em>Record</em> button.</li>
<li>Reproduce the problem (it may help to have the <a href="Leap_Visualizer.html">Leap<br/>
Visualizer</a> running).</li>
<li>Press the <em>Stop</em> button after a short period of time.</li>
<li>Click <em>Send</em> to upload the diagnostic file to ~!@<a href="https://developer.leapmotion.com">Leap<br/>
Motion</a>@!~ for analysis.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Automatic bug reporting</h3>

<p>The Leap application provides the option to automatically send<br/>
diagnostic information to Leap Motion when certain types of errors are<br/>
encountered by the Leap. This option defaults to off, but we encourage<br/>
you to turn it on to help us improve the Leap software.</p>

<p>To turn on automatic bug reporting,</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Leap Application menu using the icon on the Windows Taskbar<br/>
or Mac Finder bar.</li>
<li>Select the <em>Settings&hellip;</em> command.</li>
<li>On the Leap Settings window, click the <em>Logging</em> tab.</li>
<li>Check the <em>Auto-Send Bug Reports</em> option.</li>
<li>Click <em>OK</em>.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Application log  </h2>

<p>To view events related to the Leap application, open the application log<br/>
using the Leap application menu from the Windows Taskbar or Mac Finder<br/>
bar. If you are having problems, we may ask you to save the log and send<br/>
it to <a href="https://developer.leapmotion.com">Leap Motion</a> to help us assess<br/>
the problem. You can save the log from the <em>Logging</em> page of the<br/>
Settings dialog.</p>

<h2><a name="screen-location">Screen location</a>  </h2>

<p><strong>Screen Location is only needed to use the Screen class in the Leap<br/>
API. All other features of the Leap work without running the Screen<br/>
Locator tool.</strong></p>

<p>You can use the Screen Locator tool to register the position and<br/>
orientation of a monitor in relation to the Leap device.</p>

<p>Establishing the location of a screen is not required for most features<br/>
of the Leap to work correctly. However, when a monitor&rsquo;s position is<br/>
known, a Leap-enabled application can access additional information.<br/>
This information includes the coordinates and orientation of the screen<br/>
within the Leap coordinate system as well as the intersection points<br/>
between the screen and rays projected from fingers and tools.</p>

<p>The Screen Location tool must be run whenever the Leap or the monitor<br/>
are moved.</p>

<p>To register the location of a screen:</p>

<ol>
<li>Place the Leap device in the desired position relative to the<br/>
monitor.</li>
<li>Launch the Leap application and open the Settings window using the<br/>
Leap application menu.</li>
<li>Click the Screen tab on the Settings window.</li>
<li>Select the monitor to locate from the detected screens list (if more<br/>
than one monitor is attached to your computer).</li>
<li>Click the <em>Locate Screen</em> button.</li>
<li><p>The Leap application opens a full screen window on the selected<br/>
monitor and provides instructions on how to complete the process.</p>

<p>During the procedure, the Leap displays a sequence of circles. Place<br/>
a tool or finger into the Leap field of view and point at each<br/>
displayed circle in turn. The circle will change color when you are<br/>
pointing close enough to the circle. The more accurately you point,<br/>
the more accurate the results. It may help to sight along the tool<br/>
or finger while pointing.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <em>OK</em> or <em>Apply</em> button when finished.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>You can view the location results in the <a href="Leap_Visualizer.html">Leap<br/>
Visualizer</a>. (Press the <code>B</code> key while in the<br/>
Visualizer to display the computed screen bounds and finger-screen<br/>
intersection points.)</p>

<p>See <a href="Leap_Location.html">Screen Location</a> for information on using<br/>
screen location information in a Leap-enabled application.</p>
